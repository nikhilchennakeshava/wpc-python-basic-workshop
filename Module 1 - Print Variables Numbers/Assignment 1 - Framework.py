# Let's assume:
#  - Amy Hernandez is 10 years old.
#  - kids are 6 years old when they graduate 1st grade, 
#    and 18 years old when they graduate high school.

# Step 1:
# store the first name, last name and age of Amy in 3 variables.
# remember to use meaningful variable names
# You code here
amy_fn = 'Amy'
amy_ln = 'Herandez'
amy_age = 10


# Step 2:
# store the age at 1st grade and age at 12th grade in 2 variables.
# remember to use meaningful variable names
# You code here
    

# Step 3:
# Caculate current grade based on above variables and store in a variable
# remember to use meaningful variable names
# You code here
    

# Step 4:
# Caculate number of years to graduation based on above variables 
#  and store in a variable
# remember to use meaningful variable names
# You code here
    

# Step 5:
# Print first name, last name, age, current grade, and # years to graduation
# remember to use meaningful messages when printing out the data
# You code here


# Step 6:
# Try running your program for ages 5, 7, 17, 18, 19
# Do you see expected results?
# Note: for ages >=18, we'll learn how to write "if-statements" in later
#       modules to control what gets stored/printed
# You code here
